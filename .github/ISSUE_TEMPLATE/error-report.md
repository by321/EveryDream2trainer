**Attach log and cfg**
*PLEASE* attach the ".log" and "_cfg.json" from your logs folder for the run that failed.  This is absolutely critical to providing assistance.  These files are always generated and saved in the "logs" folder under project_name_timestamp folder every run.  For cloud hosts, you can download the files.  For Google Colab these are likely being saved to your Gdrive. 

**Runtime environment (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [e.g. Windows 10, Ubuntu Linux 22.04, etc]
 - Is this your local computer or a cloud host?  Please list the cloud host (Vast, Google Colab, etc)
 - GPU [e.g. 3090 24GB, A100 40GB]

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

Also consider posting your cfg and log to the Discord #help channel here instead, there are far more people there than will read your issue here on Github:

**Closure**
Reminder:  Please close your issue once it has been resolved and please state what you did to fix it, whether a reply helped you or you figure it out on your own.  Your issue may be closed if you do not reply to keep the backlog of issues manageable.
